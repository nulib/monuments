Exercises in Whole Notes (Semibreves)

Tritto begins with unfigured whole notes (semibreves) so as to give the beginner a context in which speed or manual dexterity is not an issue. Tritto includes chromatically altered tones from No. 4 onward. These exercises presume knowledge of the Rule of the Octave, the Simple Cadence, and the Compound Cadence. The above title has been added by the editor.

+++


Tritto introduces imitation though passages that feature an alternation between a series of short notes and one or more long notes. Clues written above or below the partimento—e.g., “imit. a 4°” is an abbreviation of“imitation at the 4th”—suggest that the short notes can form a counterpoint to the long notes, and vice versa. Beginning with No. 3, Tritto introduces changes of clef, which signal the entry of a voice or melodic motive.

[ ADVANCED ] PARTIMENTI
The partimenti written by Insanguine test the apprentice's knowledge of every rule introduced in the Rules. Each partimento focuses on a particular problem of realization, and in working his or her way from No. 1 to No. 32 the apprentice would face progressively longer and more complex challenges. Anyone capable of realizing the last few partimenti in this group will be fully prepared to begin partimento fugues, which represent the highest level of partimento training.

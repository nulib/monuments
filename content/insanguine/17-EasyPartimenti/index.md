[ EASY ] PARTIMENTI
This set of relatively easy partimenti follows the "Rules" section of Insanguine's manuscript. Because these "preparatory" partimenti end with the instruction "Here Follow the Partimenti," we can assume that Insanguine thought of these studies as somewhat below the level of difficulty of "real" partimenti. Those more challenging studies can be found by returning to the Index and selecting "[Advanced] Partimenti" or "Partimento Fugues."

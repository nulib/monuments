    <td valign="top"><p><em>Concerning this modern edition: Fenaroli frequently referred his readers to "the manuscript" where they would find the musical examples indexed in his text by one or more letters of the alphabet (e.g., "see example A.f."). Today, viewing the complex tangle of copies of Fenaroli's partimenti, it is not clear what "the manuscript" was. Nineteenth-century editors of printed editions, or possibly Fenaroli himself, took the text of Fenaroli's </em> Regole<em>, inserted musical examples to illustrated the corresponding "rules," and made the result the third of what became six books of partimenti. The editor has attempted to reconstruct the musical examples of the original, separate manuscript. Additional examples, which can be identified as those without alphbetical indices, have been added where they might prove helpful. Each represents just one possible sonic realization of the intended rule. At the end of his "rules," Fenaroli himself sanctioned this type of adaptation: "Should masters find missing rules, or errors, they may supplement and accommodate [the text] to their liking."</em>
      </p><p><em>Because the concept of the scale degree or scale step is so central to the Neapolitan school of partimenti, and because the welter of numbers for both intervals and scale degrees can be confusing, scale degrees in the bass will be marked by numbers in white circles (e.g., <img src="BassOne.gif"> ) and scale degrees in the melody by numbers in black circles (e.g., <img src="MelTwo.gif"> )</em>. <em>In many instances, Fenaroli asks his reader "to consider" a particular scale degree as if it were a different degree. In those cases, the conjectural scale degree is shown, in a lighter shade of black, below the nominal scale degree. </em></p>
      <p><em>The text is based on the above mentioned Naples print of 1775, and various manuscripts at the Naples Conservatory Library. Section headings, as listed on the index page, have been added for convenience. </em></p></td>

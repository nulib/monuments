Concerning fugal, refined, and imitative partimenti

The partimenti of Book Six are among the most difficult in the partimento literature. Nos. 2, 4, and others, for example, are canons and one is expected to perform the canon without writing it out beforehand. This is typical of the mental training requiredâ€”one must read and play one voice while performing a second voice from recent memory of the first voice. (Section headings have been provided by the editor.)

### “Le Partimento et l'organiste au XVIIIe siècle,” Music Sacra, 41 (1934): 251–54.

Karl Gustav Fellerer (1902–84) received his doctorate in 1925 (Munich) and began work in Münster in 1927, where he encountered the huge holdings of Italian manuscripts in the Santini collection. Fortunato Santini (1778–1861), a Roman priest and bibliophile, had amassed an impressive collection of partimenti, and these manuscripts formed the basis for Fellerer's first essay on partimenti. Fellerer became editor of the journal Musica sacra in 1932 and published this essay there two years later.

The original article was in French. Both the original and an English translation are presented here in parallel columns. Some errors in the printing of the bass and figures of the musical example by Sabbatini have been corrected, and the scansion of Fellerer's third example of a partimento cadence (what the Italians call [_cadenza doppia_](http://faculty-web.at.northwestern.edu/music/gjerdingen/partimenti/collections/Fenaroli/Regole/regoleP3.htm)) has been brought into line with his sources.

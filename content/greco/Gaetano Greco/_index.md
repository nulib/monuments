Unlike later sets of partimenti, where explicit regole and occasional written-out realizations help to clarify what was expected of the student, the partimenti of Gaetano Greco (ca. 1700-1720?) come to us with few clues about how they were used or played. Were they really for keyboard improvisation, or were they more like bass exercises typical of the viola da gamba? Should one add in sharps or flats where, by the standards of the next generation, they seem to have been left out? Should the many sequences be treated chromatically or diatonically? Easy access to Greco's partimenti, provided below, may aid the search for answers. (Note: There is no number 79 in the sole surviving manuscript. The partimenti were numbered by a later hand, and it is possible that a mistake was made in the tally.)

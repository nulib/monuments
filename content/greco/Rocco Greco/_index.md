The Partimenti of Rocco Greco

As preserved in MS 33.2.3 at the Naples Conservatory Library


Bass Diminution  	  
Long, Figured Partimenti  	  
Short, Unfigured Partimenti  	  

The partimenti of Rocco Greco (ca. 1650 - ca. 1718), like those of his brother Gaetano, come down to us through the single manuscript cited above. Its cover page displays “Rocco” crossed out, with “Gaetano” written below. Older hands have marked several of the first sections of the manuscript as being by Rocco. His name does not appear anywhere in the second, larger portion of the manuscript. Following tradition, those later partimenti are taken to be by Gaetano. Rocco's section has three main parts. The first section appears to present studies of bass diminutions. That is, a simple bass occupies the lower staff and an ornamented version of the same bass occupies the upper staff. Liturgical titles suggest that these basses relate to specific chants or other sacred works. One or more pages has been lost from the beginning of the manuscript, since the first bass diminution is an ending fragment of a larger piece. The second section contains long, figured partimenti. The third section contains short, unfigured partimenti.

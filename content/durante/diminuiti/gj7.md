Editor's notes: The opening of a version of the Romanesca bass (with chord changes every half-note time value--see the partimento mm. 1-3); The two styles of embellishment or "diminution" differ only in that Style 2 includes a 7-6 suspension (A5 resolving to G#5 on the last quarter-note time value).

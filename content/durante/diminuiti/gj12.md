Editor's notes: The ascending-scale movimento initiated on the third scale degree in A major. For both styles, the upper voice sounds a third above the bass, "3," on the downbeat. "6" sounds on the second (Style 1) or third (Style 2) eighth note. Though Style 1 retains elements of the 5-6-5-6... pattern, Style 2, in a fast tempo, will sound more like parallel 6/3 chords or, as the effect was once called, fauxbourdon.

Editor's notes: Style 1 continues the up-a-sixth, down-a-fifth movimento introduced in no. 32, but now in the minor mode (C minor). In Style 2, the accompaniment inserts a dominant chord before the B natural in the bass, helping to motivate, through the implied 4/2 chord, the descent of C4 back down to B3.

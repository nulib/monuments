Editor's notes: Three ways of embellishing the ascending half step in the bass from the leading tone to its tonic. The three styles, labelled in the manuscript as Primo Modo, Secondo Modo, and Terzo Modo, are in the key of A major, with a "Mixolydian" key signature of only two sharps instead of the modern three.

Editor's notes: In partimenti, tied notes (or, as in Style 1, notes holding from a weak to a strong position) implied a dissonance. The dissonance made manifest in the accompaniment is the 4/2 chord (Ab4 and F4) on beat two. Style 2 shows a treatment in parallel sixths of the up-a-fifth, down-a-fourth movimento.

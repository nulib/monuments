Editor's notes: With the exception of Style 2, Durante shows a variety of accompaniments for the up-a-sixth, down-a-fifth movimento. In Style 2, the bass A2 is the local tonic that closes a strong cadence. The melody delays that closure for an additional beat. The E3 at the end of Style 2 initiates the type of movimento shown in Style 3.

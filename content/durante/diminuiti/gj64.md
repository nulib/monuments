Editor's notes: Complex expansions of an ascending scale done without the usual 5-6-5-6... progression. Notice how the time interval between the octaves (e.g., between A3 and A4) is different in Styles 1 and 2. This helped prepare the student for the types of time stretching or compressing common in fugues (the more advanced type of partimento).

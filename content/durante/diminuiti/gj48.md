Editor's notes: Style 1 shows a simple one-note accompaniment to the bass's three-note descent to the tonic (B minor). Style 2 melds a descending sequence of three-note ascents in the bass to a delay of the final cadance. The delay features a stubborn tonic B4 that repeats itself until at last forced by the prominent C#3 bass to resolve down to A# just before completing the cadence.

Editor's notes: Two ways of treating stepwise descents that end with a half-step to the third scale degree of the local key (first C major, then D major). In the partimento, the third such descent ends on E major, which becomes the dominant of A minor. Durante later introduces variants of the descents which terminate with a whole-step, requiring the final tone to be a tonic.\

Editor's notes: A rising sequence with a call-and-response alternation between melody and bass. In terms of chordal roots, the pattern matches the up-a-fifth, down-a-fourth movimento (but beginning with the "down a fourth"). Intervallically, a third (C4-E5) expands first to an augmented fourth (C4-F#5), which further expands and resolves to a sixth (B3-G5). The process then repeats in inversion, with the sixth contracting to a diminished fifth (C#4-G5), which further contracts and resolves to an implied third (D4-F#5).

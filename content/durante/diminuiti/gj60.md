Editor's notes: The bass of Style 2 features tones tied to sixteenth-notes, and Durante shows how that rhythmic figure can be integrated into the accompaniment of Style 1. If one were to mentally draw barlines every half beat, then the dotted-eighth-and-sixteenth figures of Style 2 also have tones "tied" to sixteenths. For Style 2, Durante also proposes that the accompaniment anticipate the Bb-minor triadic motif of the partimento bass. From these and other hints we can infer that the talented student was expected to perform a compositionally integrated accompiment to Durante's partimenti.

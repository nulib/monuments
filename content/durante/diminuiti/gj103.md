Editor's notes: The down-a-third, up-a-second movimento with 7-6 suspensions. The first "7" occurs as B4 above C#4 on the second beat. That B4 resolves to A3 an octave lower. As in no. 102, the sequence ends with a 4/2 chord above the fourth scale degree (the first beat of the second measure), signally the upcoming cadence.

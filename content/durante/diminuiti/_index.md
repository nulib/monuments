When you click on an incipit below, you will be shown Durante's suggested modi or "styles" for embellishing one or more bass patterns in that partimento. You can then click on a link to the partimento itself. Traditionally, the student's challenge was to recognize where the modi might fit, whether they needed to be transposed, and how they should be connected with the rest of the partimento. For beginners, audio hints are given to suggest where the modi could be placed. These audio hints are intentionally fragmentary in order to encourage the imagination of appropriate musical continuations. The partimenti diminuiti are thus musical puzzles with many possible solutions.

Durante, an eighteenth-century composer from the J. S. Bach generation, was perhaps the central figure in the partimento tradition. In 1728 he succeeded Gaetano Greco as master at one of the Neapolitan conservatories, where he taught important young composers like Pergolesi and future maestros like Fedele Fenaroli. As a composer, Durante concentrated on church music, a focus that may reflect his experiences in Rome as a young man, where he probably studied with Pitoni and Pasquini, the latter a pioneer of partimento teaching. As a teacher, Durante was known as an authority on the fine points of harmony and counterpoint, and as author of the sophisticated and rich studies presented in this series. His partimenti set a very high standard for the combination of artistic merit and paedagogical utility. Like Chopin's Etudes or J. S. Bach's The Art of Fugue, Durante's partimenti represent significant compositions. But unlike those other collections, these partimenti must be reconstructed to reveal their full effect.

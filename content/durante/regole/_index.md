Irregularities in the order, titles, and numbering of Durante's "rules" in the source manuscripts suggest that they were collected after his death by other maestros or by students. It became traditional for a “rules” section to precede a large collection of partimenti, and the partimenti collections of the next generation almost all follow that pattern. Only a few of Durante's rules are rules in the modern sense. Most are statements introducing models for the treatment of dissonance, for cadences, and for increasingly complex sequences involving dissonances.
